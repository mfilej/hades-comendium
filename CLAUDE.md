# Hades compendium

We're building a compendium for the video game Hades. This is an early version that only focuses on boons.

The projects uses deno.

This early stage is about gathering data. We will not try to build anything with it at this time.

## Data source

We will use the Hades wiki at https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Boons - the boons can be found on each god's subpage, e.g. https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Zeus/Boons_(Hades)
